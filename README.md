# Experimental Game Boy Assembly Project

Just a bunch of template code, teaching myself how to make a simple Game Boy game. My goal is to complete a game like "tic tac toe" which includes all the basic features that comprise a game:

- Tiled background images
- Sprite images with animations
- Input
- Music and SFX

### Environment

This project is developed using Visual Studio Code on a Windows machine.

### Build

Run `make.bat`, which should build and open the `.gb` game in BGB emulator.
